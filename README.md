# Legacy Windows behaviors/ports
Welcome to LegacyWindowson10 Project! Our vision is to bring back legacy Windows behaviors and porting things from XP x64 to 10/11. Here many things will be documented and will (maybe) be explained on how it was achieved. Keep in mind we wont provide pre-patched files as it will violate Micro$oft's EULA. For now page is dry new things coming soon...
